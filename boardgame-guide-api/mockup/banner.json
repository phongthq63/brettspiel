These bonuses allow players to purchase subsequent\ndevelopment cards for a lesser cost. When a player has enough bonuses, they immediately receive a visit\nfrom a noble (which is also worth prestige points).\nAs soon as a player reaches 15 prestige points, the current turn ends and the player\nwith the most prestige points is declared the winner",
